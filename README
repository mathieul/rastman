# = Rastman is a Ruby interface for the Asterisk Manager API
#
# When creating a new Rastman::Manager instance, it connects to an Asterisk server
# on the manager port (<tt>5038</tt> by default), sends a login request
# and listens to events published by the server. The instance can also
# be used to send Manager API requests to the server.
#
# All the Asterisk Manager API commands are accessible. They can be used in two
# different ways:
#
# - name of the command in lowercase: the command is sent but Rastman doesn't wait
#   for the answer (asynchronous).
#   i.e.: rastman.setvar :variable => "my_time", :value => "12"
#
# - name of the command in lowercase with a bang: the command is sent and Rastman
#   waits for the answer (synchronous). If the answer contains a value (for Getvar)
#   then it is returned, else true is returned.
#   i.e.: value = rastman.getvar! 1, :variable => "extension"
